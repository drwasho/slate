# Errors

<aside class="notice">This error section is stored in a separate file in `includes/_errors.md`. Slate allows you to optionally separate out your docs into many files...just save them to the `includes` folder and add them to the top of your `index.md`'s frontmatter. Files are included in the order listed.</aside>

The Kittn API uses the following error codes:


Error Code | Meaning
---------- | -------
NOT_FOUND | Bad Request -- What you are asking for doesn't exist... move along.
401 | Authorization error -- The API call has failed authentication.
